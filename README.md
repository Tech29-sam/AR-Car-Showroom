# Eminent Cars: AR-Car-Showroom

### Problem Definition: 
In this project, Iâ€™ve used AR technology from Vuforia, the Unity game engine, combining with voice-controlled, cloud-based artificial intelligence to build fully functional car showroom application. Users can see the different types of cars available in a showroom with all the features without being physically present over there
A complete 3D model of a car can be placed in front of the buyer and they can check all features just by a few clicks. Also, the customers can give commands using the record button, making the app much more interactive.

### Technologies Used:
- Unity
- Vuforia
- WitAI
- Android

### System Functionality:

#### 1. Intro Scene

- Project the 3D car model in real world
- Try out different features
- Interact by voice commands

### WorkFlow:

Audio Input ----> Sending audio to cloud ----> Speech to text conversion ----> Identify entities ----> Output to Unity -----> Firing the correct model
