# ar-car-showroom
In this project, Iâ€™ve used AR to develop a voice controlled application for the Car Showroom. A complete 3D model of a car can be placed in front of the buyer and they can check all features just by a few clicks. Also, the customers can give commands using the record button, making the app much more interactive.
